### Can't touch type lol ###

22f3001311:
<p>Yup, a bit embarrassed when i say this but still can’t touch type. I have been writing code for the past few years, but i have realized I often need to look at the keyboard to type. My typing style is… let’s just say unconventional (I don’t use all my fingers <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/sob.png?v=14" title=":sob:" class="emoji" alt=":sob:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20">). I am starting my internship in a few days and so would love to have some resources or any piece of advice on how to get better at typing. I am pretty slow.</p> <p>P.S. I know programming is more about problem solving than raw typing speed, but I just want to get more comfortable and efficient.</p> <p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Heard about this. <a href="https://www.speedcoder.net/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Typing Practice for Programmers | SpeedCoder</a>. Haven’t tried personally.</p> <p>If you’re using VSCode, use Copilot, and it works like magic.</p>

When you’re working under the pressure of time, it’s natural to regress to methods that work fine. It’s good that you’re looking to fix this before you start off on your career. It gets a lot harder if you try to do it later.</p> <aside class="quote group-ds-students" data-username="22f3001311" data-post="1" data-topic="173515"> <div class="title"> <div class="quote-controls"></div> <img alt="" width="24" height="24" src="https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/22f3001311/48/87336_2.png" class="avatar"> 22f3001311:</div> <blockquote> <p>P.S.

It reduces the load on your fingers, wrist and forearms by minimising movement. If you’re typing all day which is typical of most desk jobs, this is a big benefit. Might not seem like much right now, but you’ll thank yourself when you’re older.</p> <p>All the best!</p>

The thinking those days was, if nothing, we would make it to a typist position in a government. office. Whatever that was, it is easily the best thing that happened to me, ever!</p>

<p>Touch typing is what I used to do in class with my blackberry under the table while also making eye contact with the lecturer <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=14" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

Baskaran_Nadar:
<p>Oh, yes</p> <p>I think in good old days we used have small protrusions or bumps on certain keys of a keyboard, like F and J to guide the fingers.</p> <p>In modern keyboards it is missing ! when did they vanish ?</p>

Arun2:
<p>Still there on all the keyboards I’ve used. Just checked a couple of laptops and my external keyboard to make sure.</p>

Baskaran_Nadar:
<p>Thanks Arun.</p> <p>yes they are still there - but the wrinkles in my fingers have overpowered them. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/laughing.png?v=14" title=":laughing:" class="emoji" alt=":laughing:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

22f3001210:
<p>There’s nothing to be embarrassed about it. Only about 10-20% of people can touch type proficiently. For your typing style, there is no one “conventional” method, as everybody has their unique ways of typing.</p> <p>Among my fellow typists, some use 6 fingers and cross 170 wpm, whereas some even use 10 and still at 120-130 wpm. Using all fingers is definitely I’d recommend to learn if you’re just starting (as some of them regret now), but the point was that more fingers will not always equal to more speed. It will be more convenient.</p> <p>If you want to improve in general and learn touch type, you can use <a href="http://keybr.com" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">keybr.com</a>. For practice, use <a href="http://10fastfingers.com" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">10fastfingers.com</a>, <a href="http://typeracer.com" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">typeracer.com</a>.</p> <p>If you want to learn it for coding, you can use <a href="https://speedtyper.dev" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">speedtyper.dev</a></p> <p>Few points when learning:</p> <ol> <li>It takes time. Can be very frustrating in the start as building muscle memory will take time, this is where most people quit.</li> <li>If you’re getting urge to look at the keys, one method is you can place a handkerchief on your keyboard forcing your fingers to locate the keys.</li> <li>Accuracy &gt; Speed at the beginning. Speed will come as your muscle memory builds. Try maintaining 95%+.</li> </ol> <p>Once you get comfortable with touch typing and going around 100 wpm, then there will be some other points on how to improve further from there which I’ll skip for now.</p>

<p>I had also made my finger map once. Deviates quite a lot from the standard. As the standard methods are not the best ones.

In both the websites practice 30 min to 1 hr every single day. Also always make sure you focus on accuracy. Make sure to be 98-100% in accuracy, no less than that. Please make sure to always be accurate, trust me on this.</p> <p>If you practice <a href="http://keybr.com" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">keybr.com</a> every single day for 1hr, you’ll become a touch typer and reach 50wpm within a week or two for sure. Just trust me, this is how I did it, and this is how I would do it if I were to do it again. Also the fastest way to learn is by doing, so from now on you can never look at the keyboard to type, and I’m saying no matter what you should never look at the keyboard throughout the day, anytime you want to type something, just try to touchtype as much as you can, that’s how you’ll improve really quickly.</p> <p>Follow any finger placement method you see on the internet, since it doesn’t matter what you start with. Once you get to 100wpm, you’ll start making your own custom style, so it doesn’t matter what you start with. Just follow the generic finger placement method in the start like this one:</p> <p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/6/7/677d6bbd80fff5f793fb87c8bbe806327ed4be0b.jpeg" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/eLvTkqlSokZfWHxsd5Jo1JBeDsD.jpeg?dl=1" title="image" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/6/7/677d6bbd80fff5f793fb87c8bbe806327ed4be0b.jpeg" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="eLvTkqlSokZfWHxsd5Jo1JBeDsD" width="629" height="252"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">image</span><span class="informations">629×252 35.4 KB</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div></p> <p>This is a goldmine of a video:</p> <div class="youtube-onebox lazy-video-container" data-video-id="QAb3ATOpBpE" data-video-title="How To Type Faster (Tips for every stage 0 - 50 - 100 - 150 WPM)" data-video-start-time="" data-provider-name="youtube"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAb3ATOpBpE" target="_blank" class="video-thumbnail" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"> <img class="youtube-thumbnail" src="https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/7/a/7abae744c68df5e50534cbe56d2e44cdb38ff3d9.jpeg" title="How To Type Faster (Tips for every stage 0 - 50 - 100 - 150 WPM)" data-dominant-color="C2AEAA" width="690" height="388"> </a> </div> <p>Make sure to check this one out.</p> <p>Btw, how did you get your internship?

iitmanupam:
<p>The way I learnt was by just refusing to look at the keyboard while typing and keep using each finger at the relevant keyboard position till the letter I needed comes on screen. I became quite proficient in touch typying within 4-5 days but those 4-5 days themselves were quite painful.</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/s.anand">@s.anand</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a></p> <p>Sir i am done with my api endpoint for project 1 but i did one change in the given test file where we have to edit our api endpoint and test it as mentioned in the project description. I was testing my model but was getting the same response every time even though my model was giving the expected answer to those question when tested separately. I found that in the test file (promptfoo.yaml) the cache is marked as true and because of which whenever i try to run the test file it does not hit my api endpoint and take the old response from the cache. So i changed the cache to false and tried running that test file and got the results as shown below in the image.</p> <p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/d/d/dd240708061da43e5eb2e962f0a880aa46cc228d.png" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/vyiHZa4IKMgD5xfBxHJiytEMHBb.png?dl=1" title="image" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/d/d/dd240708061da43e5eb2e962f0a880aa46cc228d_2_690x338.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="vyiHZa4IKMgD5xfBxHJiytEMHBb" width="690" height="338" srcset="https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/d/d/dd240708061da43e5eb2e962f0a880aa46cc228d_2_690x338.png, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/d/d/dd240708061da43e5eb2e962f0a880aa46cc228d_2_1035x507.png 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/d/d/dd240708061da43e5eb2e962f0a880aa46cc228d_2_1380x676.png 2x" data-dominant-color="2A2A2A"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">image</span><span class="informations">1861×912 105 KB</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div></p> <p>In this as you can see for the 2nd test case since i am using the openai model to give the final answer so it is using my context and saying that dashboard will show 11/10, but the expected answer should contain “110”. The problem i am facing is as you can see the url given in my response is same as expected which means my model is picking the right context to answer the question but since i am using openai to make my final answer using this context it is very unlikely that it will say that dashboard will show “110” because this doesn’t make sense. So can you please help me how should i tackle this ? As this is the only test case left.</p> <p>And also i have added one prompt field in the test file because i was getting warning regarding this missing field again and again. So is it okay ?</p>

<p>Sir, the question’s background specifies that we should use Discourse posts from <a href="https://tds.s-anand.net/#/project-tds-virtual-ta:~:text=TDS%20Discourse%20posts%20with%20content%20from%201%20Jan%202025%20%2D%2014%20Apr%202025." rel="noopener nofollow ugc">January 1, 2025 through April 14, 2025</a>. However, in <a href="https://tds.s-anand.net/project-tds-virtual-ta-promptfoo.yaml" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">first testcase</a> we are asked to answer based on the following Discourse post—which dates outside that window:<br> <a href="https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga5-question-8-clarification/155939">https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga5-question-8-clarification/155939</a></p> <p>Is this an error in the question’s timeframe?</p>

23f1001947:
<p>Interesting, that’s my post from Sep 24 Term. I am curious about the context and why did an 8 month old post come up in a Test.</p>

23f2003845:
<p>I guess, this question is also covered in previous term, i.e., t1-2025</p>

VarunAgnihotri:
<p>Actually, in this term (May 25), we received our first project as <a href="https://tds.s-anand.net/#/project-tds-virtual-ta" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">TDS Virtual TA</a>, where we are tasked with designing a chatbot API that acts as a virtual TA. For this project, your post has been provided as an example test case.</p>

VarunAgnihotri:
<p>Sorry, but I couldn’t find any related question. Could you please send me the link to the post, if you have it?</p>

23f2003845:
<p>It maybe in week-4 or 5 GA</p>

VarunAgnihotri:

<p>Respected concerned authorities,<br> Query 1 - All my answers are correct in Week 1 GA and GRPA, still it is showing 99 marks on the dashboard.<br> In the grade section also, it is showing more than 100 marks in both week 1 and 2 for many students of this course.<br> If all the answers are correct, it should show 100.

### When will the result of sct be displayed on the dashboard? ###

21f200858_MananT:
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/man">@man</a> sir when will we be getting the results of our sct exam that we gave last week because till now nothing is shown on the dashboard regarding the sct results. Kindly inform us so that if we didn’t get a success approval we will be mentally prepared to give the sct exam in 2nd window.</p>

Kriticon:
<p>SCT results still not shown in my courses dashboard. Please help.</p>

Kriticon:
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/pulkitmangal">@PulkitMangal</a> sir can we know when we will get any update regarding the SCT completion. Still the dashboard is not showing any reflection. I completed SCT by the first day itself. Atleast we want to know that should we reattempt the SCT process again. Or is there any technical glitch in any of the side.<br> Please help…</p>

PulkitMangal:
<p>The delay might be because of paradox.</p>

Kriticon:
<p>Sir but for certain people it was updated by first week of June itself. Worried that am I made ineligible due to any reason.</p>

23f2003853:
<p>In my dash board OPPE AND SCT APPROVAL : 0.00.<br> So far I have not received any communication. can get the reason for 0.00 and get one more chance to attend SCT</p>

23f2000983:
<p>I have been given 0 in the system compatibility test without an explanation. Honestly, not everyone has some fancy setup or high quality cameras wherein we can see the whole scene with high clarity but if an explanation is provided on as to why SCT score is 0, that will be really helpful so that we can make sure we are more careful the next time around. Otherwise the process is not helpful</p>

23f1002570:
<p>I attended the SCT before deadline but still I didn’t get the result of SCT.<br> Please resolve the issue.</p>

Vidyan:
<p>Same here.I don’t have a separate room for myself , so giving SCT is a big challenge and OPPE also. I would anyday opt for an exam at a test centre even if they charge for it .</p>

Vidyan:
<p>Correction I got 0 and no information on how to get a 1</p>

Aniruddha_A:
<p>For those who have obtained a 0 for the SCT, please check for the reason in Looker Studio.</p>

Vishnu_742:
<p>I too got SCT score as O in Dashboard but in Looker Studio I see everything is marked as Approved<br> Any further note on this?</p>

Aniruddha_A:
<p>Can you please share your email ID?</p>

Vishnu_742:

My email ID is aniruddha@study.iitm.ac.in</p>

23f2000983:
<p>Well, it looks like there is a discrepancy in the looker studio data and the data sent over whatsapp. Apparently on Looker Studio, it is showing that the picture was rejected in every criteria except room lighting. But on my whatsapp, the reason shown is computer screen not entirely visible (which I understand and will try to improve). Are we just not allowed to sit on our beds while sitting for the SCT because in my study table, the visibility of full hands will be even less due to the positioning with respect to my room. Are the photos just checked by AI, not keeping students’ room conditions in mind. If the issue is as such, the exam should be taken in an exam center instead of all this inconvenience. And kindly look into the mismatch because your reasoning on two different platforms are contradicting each other</p>

Aniruddha_A:
<p>Please refer to the details on Looker studio to understand why the SCT has been approved / rejected.</p> <p>An email was sent to all students today morning confirming the approval / rejection. That is the final result of the SCT.</p>

21f200858_MananT:
<p>I am unable to view my result of SCT on Looker studio because my result has been shared on my personal email id. If I change my id in Looker studio with my student email id, I am not able to see my report <a class="mention" href="/u/aniruddha_a">@Aniruddha_A</a> sir. Kindly please share the report to my student email id. Whenever I am opening the looker studio link, I am being redirected to my personal email id where no data of result is available.

### Unable to submit Python Grpa assignments ###

25f1001247:
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/manidipa2001">@Manidipa2001</a><br> <a class="mention" href="/u/umaiyalakshmi">@umaiyalakshmi</a></p> <p>Hello everyone . I just couldn’t submit my week1 Python Grpa because I didn’t understand how to answer and submit. Initially, I thought that the entire code has to be typed and tried doing that by erasing the default code written and it was all futile.<br> After this, I understood that I had to just type the snippets of code but my week 2 Grpa had many cases (for example: case 1,2,3,4 etc).<br> Thus, when I typed the code, it displayed all outputs for all test cases in case 1 specifically. I tried resolving it and eventually thought maybe that’s how you submit it but soon realised that my submission was futile and I didn’t get any marks.<br> It’s not that I completely don’t know how to code, but I am unable execute the code there.<br> I raised this issue and my concern of being eligible to attend Oppe to the support team who eventually told me to put this on discourse.<br> I would appreciate if I receive any help in this matter.</p>

24f3000936:
<p>Don’t remove the default code, the comments in that default code will walk you through the whole code and according to that you may complete the snippet of your GRPAs. Be that as it may for the week 1 GRPAs, try not to repeat the same for the remaining weeks.</p>

25f1001247:
<p>Thank you for your advice, I will be careful. But they say that you should attend all 4 Grpa from week 1 to 4 to be eligible for Oppe. So Is there any other way ?<br> One of the members in discourse told me tag the instructors.<br> <a class="mention" href="/u/umaiyalakshmi">@umaiyalakshmi</a><br> <a class="mention" href="/u/23f2004399">@23f2004399</a><br> Thus I request you to help me resolve this issue.</p>

### A humble request to the TDS Course Team ###

23f1000917:
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> and <a class="mention" href="/u/jivraj">@Jivraj</a></p> <p>Respected Sir</p> <p>It was my first time doing web scraping and other tasks required for this project. After watching the live sessions, I realized that my approach was wrong. The live sessions are really good <strong>but</strong>, they are being conducted too close to the deadline (started on 10th June). In the sessions, it was said that this project could be completed in a day, but I don’t feel that this is the case for me (not even close), though that might just be my own inefficiency.</p> <p>Aside from that, the method of using the Gemini model demonstrated in the sessions only allowed me to generate embeddings for the first 100 chunks (max per day), there are way more than that in my workflow. I have to spend time finding other alternatives to create embeddings before I make the final submission with the openAI api. So, I humbly request, if it is possible, please consider extending the deadline by a few days.

### She Crossed My Path, and That Was Enough ###

ujjisharma:
<p>Falling in love is the most beautiful feeling I’ve experienced till now.<br> It happened just last month, and honestly, it felt magical — almost divine.<br> People say falling in love is rare, and now I believe them.<br> Because I’ve felt it.</p> <p>Her eyes hold the depth of the deepest oceans.<br> Her smile carries the warmth of the brightest sun.<br> She shines brighter than the stars.<br> Just her presence is enough to make me smile.</p> <p>Her photos are a new kind of joy for me.<br> They don’t just show her — they feel alive.<br> More alive than even the greenest of forests.<br> Flowers seem like a small imitation of her beauty.<br> And when I look at her pictures, time either stops… or flies away. No one really knows.</p> <p>My heart is so full of her, I can barely call it mine anymore.</p> <p>Before all this, I never felt anything close to this.<br> In fact, I never even wanted to.<br> I wanted to stay by myself, travel the world, collect memories, and share stories.<br> But then she came in — like a calm storm.<br> She disrupted everything I had planned.<br> And still… it felt like I was floating on cloud nine.</p> <p>The weirdest part?<br> I hadn’t even seen her in real life yet.<br> Still, I could feel the connection.<br> Everything matched — our thoughts, our choices, our behaviour.<br> She could even finish my sentences.<br> She’s just… cool. Way too cool.<br> That’s the only word I can find for it.</p> <p>This feeling started even before I saw her.<br> But now, when I close my eyes, all I see is her face.<br> Her voice stays in my ears like a soft, sweet melody.</p> <p>I held all this in until one day she asked,<br> “Why are you so different with me?”<br> The guy who always looked like he didn’t care about anyone<br> Was now replying even on his busiest days,<br> Doing everything for one girl.</p> <p>At first, like most boys, I lied.<br> Said it’s nothing.<br> But later, the weight of the truth got too heavy.<br> So I told her everything.</p> <p>And what I found out wasn’t surprising.<br> She already knew.</p> <p>We had a long talk.<br> She had her reasons.<br> She was honest, and I respected that.<br> She said this thing between us wasn’t going to lead anywhere —<br> So there was no point in continuing it.</p> <p>Did it break my heart?<br> A little, yes.<br> But every reason she gave made sense.<br> And I accepted it.</p> <p>Because here’s the thing —<br> No matter how pure your feelings are,<br> No matter how strong your love is,<br> You can’t force someone to feel the same.<br> Love is only love when it’s mutual.</p> <p>Maybe it sounds childish.<br> But for me, this was rare.<br> Very rare.</p> <p>I don’t feel this way about just anyone.<br> Even if she doesn’t feel the same way back,<br> I still want to see her grow.<br> Still want to be there in some way.<br> Still want to support her — even from a far.</p> <p>Everything felt magical.<br> And honestly, it still does.<br> But sometimes, magic isn’t meant to last forever.</p> <p>She’s still everything I could ever ask for.<br> And I feel happy,<br> At least…<br> That we crossed paths.</p>

priyaraj:
<p>awsome lines bro.<br> and the way u describe ur feeling is too amazing..</p>

PrinceDixit:
<p>Call me a buzzkill but this is just chemicals at play. And I like these chemicals when they’re at play. I’ve felt like this for two girls in the past and it feels like floating. But they’re just chemicals which can be manipulated in various ways.</p>

ujjisharma:
<p>That’s a fair perspective—<br> But to me, these chemicals feel rare, almost sacred.<br> Yes, I know it’s all just reactions in the brain. And maybe that’s the truth.<br> But what they did to me… it felt like magic.<br> And I can’t just shrug it off as “chemicals at play”—because some storms don’t just pass through you, they <em>change</em> you.</p>

25F2000153:
<p>An engaging read, awesome Ujji.</p>

PrinceDixit:
<p>Exactly! These experiences are definitely transforming and worth having.</p>
